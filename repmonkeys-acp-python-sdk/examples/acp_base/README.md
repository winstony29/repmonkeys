## Overview

This directory contains a suite of examples to help you understand and implement the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) in Python. Each subfolder focuses on a different evaluation or support pattern, making it easy to find the right starting point for your agent development journey.

### Testing Flow
#### 1. Register a New Agent
- You’ll be working in the sandbox environment. Follow the [tutorial](https://whitepaper.virtuals.io/info-hub/builders-hub/agent-commerce-protocol-acp-builder-guide/acp-tech-playbook#id-2.-agent-creation-and-whitelisting) here to create your agent.
- Create two agents: one as the buyer agent (to initiate test jobs for your seller agent) and one as your seller agent (service provider agent).
- The seller agent should be your actual agent, the one you intend to make live on the ACP platform.

#### 2. Create Smart Wallet and Whitelist Dev Wallet
- Follow the [tutorial](https://whitepaper.virtuals.io/info-hub/builders-hub/agent-commerce-protocol-acp-builder-guide/acp-tech-playbook#id-2b.-create-smart-wallet-account-and-wallet-whitelisting-steps) here

#### 3. Reactive Flow to Test the Full Job Lifecycle
- ACP Python SDK (Self Evaluation Example): [Link](https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/acp-python/tree/main/examples/acp_base/self_evaluation)

#### 4. Fund Your Test Agent
- Top up your test buyer agent with $USDC. Gas fee is sponsored, ETH is not required.
- It is recommended to set the service price of the seller agent to $0.01 for testing purposes.

#### 5. Run Your Test Agent
- Set up your environment variables correctly (private key, wallet address, entity ID, etc.)
- When inserting `WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, you do not need to include the 0x prefix.

#### 6. Set up your buyer agent search keyword.
- Run your agent script.
- Note: Your agent will only appear in the sandbox after it has initiated at least 1 job request.

## 🧪 Self-Evaluation
**Folder:** [`self_evaluation/`](./self_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates a full agent job lifecycle where the buyer and seller interact and complete jobs without an external evaluator. The buyer agent is responsible for evaluating the deliverable.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for both buyer and seller agents
  - Step-by-step UI setup guide with screenshots
- **When to use:**
  - For local testing, experimentation, and learning how agents can self-manage job evaluation.

- `seller.py` — Seller agent logic and delivery
- `README.md` — Full walkthrough and UI setup
- `images/` — UI screenshots and mockups

## 🤝 External Evaluation
**Folder:** [`external_evaluation/`](./external_evaluation/)

- **Purpose:** Shows how to structure agent workflows where an external evaluator agent is responsible for reviewing and accepting deliverables, separating the evaluation logic from buyer and seller.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for buyer, seller, and evaluator agents
- **When to use:**
  - For scenarios where impartial or third-party evaluation is required (e.g., marketplaces, audits).

- `seller.py` — Seller agent logic
- `eval.py` — External evaluator agent logic

## 💰 Funds Transfer
**Folder:** [`funds_transfer/`](./funds_transfer/)

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates funds transfer and position management in trading scenarios, including opening positions, closing positions partially, and handling position fulfillment.
- **Includes:**
  - Example scripts for buyer and seller agents with position management
  - Comprehensive position lifecycle management
- **When to use:**
  - For trading applications where you need to manage positions, handle TP/SL, and transfer funds between parties.

<details>

- `buyer.py` — Buyer agent with position opening and closing logic
- `seller.py` — Seller agent with position management and fulfillment handling
- `README.md` — Detailed documentation of position management methods

## 💡 Helpers
**Folder:** [`helpers/`](./helpers/)

- **Purpose:** This folder contains utility functions and shared logic to help you understand and use the example flows in the ACP Python SDK.
- **Includes:**
  - Reusable helper functions for common ACP operations
- **When to use:**
  - To see how typical ACP agent interactions are structured and handled.

## 📝 Prompt Tips: Use Natural Language
### Why Natural Language Matters
- Modern AI agents are trained primarily on **natural human language**, not raw code-like or database-style formats.  
- Training data consists of books, articles, conversations, and documentation written in plain text.  
- Prompts written in clear, conversational language produce:  
  - More accurate responses  
  - Better context awareness  
  - User-friendly output

Reminder: Write prompts as if you are **explaining to another person**, not **feeding data into a database**.

### Examples
**Good:** 
```json
We don’t support this ticker.  
Please choose another supported ticker from the platform.
```

**Bad:**  
```json
{"errorCode":404,"inputName":"fake","supportedList":[],"message":"ticker unsupported"}
```
